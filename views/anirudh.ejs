			<div class="question">Question 1: Tell us something about yourself.(include your placed co.)</div>

			<div class="answer">Answer: I am N. Anirudh Raju pursuing production engineering. I am placed in Hero Motocorp and currently interning with Dr. Reddy's laboratories and both are core profiles.</div>
		</div>

		<div class="qna-section">
			<div class="question">Question 2: How to prepare for the companies of that sector?</div>

			<div class="answer">Answer: Core companies can be cracked easily. You just have to build a good resume depicting your experiences in the field and having strong core knowledge. Other than that I would suggest participating in competitions organised by companies having a PPO or PPI reward. This might be very helpful.
			</div>
		</div>

		<div class="qna-section">
			<div class="question">Question 3: Describe the selection procedure of that company.</div>

				<div class="answer">Answer:  DRL's procedure was quite easy with just an online test and PI.
				Hero Motocorp was an offcampus opportunity availing my PPI.
			</div>
		</div>

		<div class="qna-section">
			<div class="question">Question  4:Now coming to the most dreaded part of every recruitment process, describe your interview(s)(include projects)</div>

			<div class="answer">Answer: 
			<ul style="margin-left:20px">
			<li>Selection procedure for DRL was quite easy. It had an online test succeeded by a PI. Online test had basic core mechanical questions. PI was strictly resume based. You just need to confidently describe your projects and internships,</li>

			<li>On the other hand, Hero Motocorp was tough as this was offcampus. I grabbed a ppi last year in Hero campus challenge season 5 then I had to give its interview where the questions were purely based on deep core concepts of mechanical engineering.</li></ul>
			</div>
		</div>

		<div class="qna-section">
			<div class="question">Question 5:As you mentioned that projects played a vital role in your placement, what were the projects that you did?</div>

			<div class="answer">Answer:Some of my projects are as follows - 
			<ul style="margin-left:20px">
				 <li>My first project was my internship at Tata Motors where  I had to study the formation process of Long Members and PTCED process and optimise the time taken in the process.</li>

				<li>Second Project was the internship at Tata Steel R&D under Mind Over Matter competition. It's was a research thesis on biocoke formation for steel making process.</li>

				<li>Third one was my final year research project titled Process Evaluation of Friction Stir Welding.</li>

				<li>Apart from this I had minor training project at IIT Kharagpur based on coding of Kuka Robots.</li>
