			<div class="question">Question 1: Tell us something about yourself.(include your placed co.)</div>

			<div class="answer">Answer:I'm Ritwick Sharma. I'm from Jamshedpur. I'm currently pursuing my bachelor's degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE). I was a part of only one club, Robolution. In my spare time, I like to play FIFA or watch series/movies.
I got placed in <b>Cypress Semiconductors (an Infineon Company)</b>.</div>

			<div class="question">Question 2: How to prepare for the companies of that sector?</div>

			<div class="answer">Answer:  When it comes to the preparation for a core electronics company, you should be thorough with the core subjects that are in the semester syllabus, but that’s not sufficient.  Apart from that, the topics that are very important from the placement point of view are as follows:
			<ul style="margin-left:20px;">
				<li>Digital Electronics: GATE book by Made easy, Lecture series by Prof.S. Srinivasan IIT Madras/Neso Academy</li>
				<li>Analog Electronics: Electronics I and Electronics II (up to lecture 16)/ Book by Dr. Behzad Razavi(for numerical and theory as well)</li>
				<li>CMOS Digital Electronics: – From Jan M. Rabaey (Chapters 3, 5, and 6)/ Lecture on Digital VLSI by Dr. Sudeb Dasgupta IIT Roorkee.</li>
				<li>Verilog HDL: – Lecture series by Dr. Indranil Sengupta IIT Kharagpur/Book by Samir Palnitkar(First 8 chapters).</li>
				<li>Computer organization and architecture: - Pipelining, Amdahl’s Law, Cache memory, Virtual Memory from lectures by Dr. Ajit Pal/COA lecture series by Gate Smashers. For virtual memory refer to videos by David Black-Schaffer on YouTube.</li>
				<li>Static Timing Analysis: - From vlsiexperts.com/Lecture 33 and 34 by Prof. Tuhin Subhra Chakraborty IIT Kharagpur.</li>
				<li>Memories: - ROM (Basics), RAM- SRAM (6T), and DRAM (1T) (Complete Operation) from a lecture by Dr. Amitava Dasgupta, IIT Madras.</li>
				<li>Microprocessor and Microcontroller: 8085 from R. Gaonkar/A.P. Malvino, 8086 Architecture, Microcontroller Architecture (8051).</li>
				<li>Apart from these, the other topics are RLC circuit in-depth analysis (for this you can refer to Lecture Series by Gate academy), Active and Passive Filters, Fabrication Process, ASIC Design Methodology, Frequency divider circuits (f/2, f/3 with 50% duty cycle from Ganesh Acharya video), FIFO Depth calculation.
				<li>You must solve the GATE previous year questions on analog and digital electronics.</li>
				<li>One should also have a good knowledge of the C language.</li>
			</ul>
			</div>
		</div>

		<div class="qna-section">
			<div class="question">Question 3: Describe the selection procedure of that company.</div>

				<div class="answer">Answer: The selection procedure consisted of an online test, followed by three rounds of interviews. The online test had six sections. Before the start of the test, we were asked to give our preferences among Software and Hardware. All the questions were objective having a single correct answer with no negative marking. The allotted time was 73 minutes, and an individual section timer was also there. 
				<ol style="margin-left:20px;">
					<p> <li>The first section consisted of 10 general aptitude questions.</li> 
					<li>The second one consisted of 10 Python-related questions.</li> 
					<li>The third one consisted of 6 Microprocessor related questions.</li>
					<li>The fourth section consisted of 10 questions related to Analog Electronics. Questions were from transient analysis, the small-signal model of MOS, gain related questions. 
					<li>The fifth section consisted of 10 questions related to Digital Electronics. Questions were from STA, FSM, counters, combinational and sequential circuits.</li>
					<li>The sixth section consisted of 10 questions related to C/Embedded C.</li></p>
				</ol>

		<div class="qna-section">
			<div class="question">Question  4:Now coming to the most dreaded part of every recruitment process, describe your interview(s)(include projects)</div>

			<div class="answer">Answer: There were 2 Technical interview rounds and 1 HR round.
			First Technical Interview- In this round, questions were asked based on my projects. One of my projects was Self-Balancing Bot, from which the interviewer asked many questions covering the protocols (I2C, UART, SPI), sensors involved, and we had a long discussion on future modifications in that. Then I was asked some questions from Arduino, ADC, DAC, Wireless protocols (Wi-Fi, Zigbee, Bluetooth), and a lot from C.
			Second Technical Interview- In this round, the interviewers went deep into the Self-Balancing Bot project. They asked me about the controller I used (PID), in-depth discussion about PID, how you calculated the angle, etc. Then they asked, "Which is your favourite subject?". I went with Digital Electronics. So, they asked me a few questions on the same and then a few real-life scenario questions.
			The last round was the HR round, which focused on behavioural skills.

		<div class="qna-section">
			<div class="question">Question 5:As you mentioned that projects played a vital role in your placement, what were the projects that you did?</div>

			<div class="answer">Answer: At the end of my first year, to get into Robolution, the shortlisted students were given a summer project based on which selection was done. That summer, I built the <b>Self-Balancing Bot</b>, which was my first project, and which also made a significant contribution to my selection procedure at Cypress. At the end of my 2nd year, I did an internship at IIT KGP, where my teammates and I built an Autonomous Bot. At the end of my 3rd year, I designed an <b>Asynchronous and a Synchronous FIFO using Verilog in ModelSim</b>.</div>
		</div>

		<div class="qna-section">
			<div class="question">Question 6:How being a part of Robolution helped you in gaining an edge over other candidates?</div>

			<div class="answer">Answer: I was a part of Robolution since my second year. Being a part of this club gave me the opportunity to work as a team (this skill is always a plus for any company) and multidisciplinary exposure to interact with people from different branches and different years (this made me social as being social is an important aspect of being a good employee who knows how to communicate his thoughts). Organizing workshops on embedded systems and technical events developed my interest in Electronics and working for Robocon late at night after classes taught me how to maintain a work-life balance. And the projects I did while being a part of this club helped me a lot in my selection procedure. Apart from all this, you will get a family and memories to cherish lifelong.</div>

			<div class="question">Question 7:Any extra advice to your juniors for technical skills that they should develop?</div>

			<div class="answer">Answer:  First of all, you need to know in which field you are interested. For this, I would suggest keep on exploring in your 1st year, and if you are interested in coding, then start right away from your 2nd year since companies like Microsoft and Goldman Sachs start coming to college at the start of 3rd year. And if you are still confused between core and coding, take a little bit more time in your 2nd year and make the right choice. I personally started my preparation at the end of my 5th semester as internship opportunities in the core are less in our college but you never know what will happen next year. So better find your interest and start working on it as soon as possible. For coding peeps, I am not the right person to guide, but for core peeps, be thorough with the basics, and I have already mentioned the syllabus although that's not fixed as it varies from company to company, which you will get to know from the seniors placed in different companies for that be active on LinkedIn, make connections and ask seniors how to prepare, etc.</div>
